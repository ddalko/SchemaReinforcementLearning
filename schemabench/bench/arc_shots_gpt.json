        "question": "A force of 5 N is required to increase the speed of a box from a rate of 1.0 m/s to 3.0 m/s within 5 s along a level surface. What change would most likely require additional force to produce the same results?",
        "thought": "To determine what would require additional force, we must consider how mass affects force. Increasing the mass of the box would require more force to achieve the same acceleration.",
        "answer": "B",
        "choices": {
            "A": "reduce the mass of the box",
            "B": "increase the mass of the box",
            "C": "make the surfaces of the box smooth",
            "D": "make the surface of the floor smooth"

        "question": "A hiker wants to know if air is warmer in a forest than in the nearby farm field. Which activity would best help the hiker find out which area is warmer?",
        "thought": "To determine which area is warmer, the hiker needs to measure and compare the temperature at both locations. This gives direct evidence of which area has higher temperatures.",
        "answer": "D",
        "choices": {
            "A": "reading a book about farm fields",
            "B": "making a weather prediction for the forests",
            "C": "measuring the wind speed at both locations",
            "D": "recording the temperatures at both locations"

        "question": "Visible light in the electromagnetic spectrum",
        "thought": "Visible light is actually a small part of the much larger electromagnetic spectrum, which includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. Therefore, it is a narrow band within the spectrum.",
        "answer": "B",
        "choices": {
            "A": "is a broad band within the spectrum.",
            "B": "is a narrow band within the spectrum.",
            "C": "makes up 50 percent of the spectrum.",
            "D": "makes up more than 75 percent of the spectrum."
